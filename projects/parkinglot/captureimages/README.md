Scripts that run on a Raspberry Pi (or other camera enabled device) to capture images.

`capture.py`: Script to take photo and upload it to Azure blob.

`post_id.py`: Script to post current network IP to a slack channel. Not necessary for `capture.py`, but it was useful for initially setting up the Raspberry Pi's.
